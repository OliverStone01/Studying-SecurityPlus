### Network Infrastructure Concepts

<details>
  <summary>1. What is an air gap?</summary>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. What does a VLAN do?</summary>
  - A VLAN allows you to segment your switch into separate local networks.  
    This is useful because VLANs are unable to directly talk to one another, making them similar to a physical air gap.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. What is the name of the process of devices like switches and routers performing multiple actions simultaneously?</summary>
  - The planes of operation.
</details>

<details>

  - Data plane, Control plane, and Management plane.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10. What is the data plane?</summary>
  - The data plane handles all the routing, forwarding, encrypting, and processing of frames — anything related to data processing.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>11. What is the control plane?</summary>
  - The control plane manages how data is transferred between devices, including routing decisions and path selection.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>12. What is the management plane?</summary>

  - A jump server is a device on a network that can be connected to from outside the network.  
    It has extreme security and limited access.
</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. What is a proxy server?</summary>
  - A proxy server sits between devices and makes requests on behalf of the devices it’s connected to.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. Where are proxy servers commonly seen?</summary>
  - Between a device and the internet.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Explain the process of using a proxy server.</summary>
  - The device makes a request which is sent to the proxy server.  
    The proxy server then makes the request, receives the data, checks for malicious code, and sends it to the device (or rejects it).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. What is caching on a proxy server?</summary>
  - Proxy servers cache requests so that repeated queries can be served faster without making the same request again.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. What other feature do proxy servers have?</summary>
  - URL filtering — allowing or blocking users from accessing specific sites.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. What is an explicit proxy?</summary>
  - A proxy that needs to be configured manually in the application or operating system.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10. What is a transparent proxy?</summary>
  - A proxy that the end user is unaware of; it automatically operates between the user and the internet without manual configuration.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>11. What proxies understand the application protocols?</summary>
  - Application layer proxies.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>12. What is a very simple proxy?</summary>

  - A reverse proxy.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>15. What is an open proxy?</summary>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>16. What is a load balancer?</summary>
  - Distributes requests made to a web server across multiple servers to reduce load and improve response time.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>17. What does it mean if a load balancer is running in active/active mode?</summary>
  - All servers are being used by the load balancer.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>18. What is TCP offloading?</summary>
  - When using load balancers, TCP connections can be reused instead of creating a new one for every request.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>19. What is another feature of load balancers that involves encryption?</summary>
  - Load balancers can manage SSL encryption and decryption for traffic between clients and servers.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>20. What does it mean when a load balancer is setup in an active/passive setup?</summary>
  - Some servers handle traffic while others remain on standby to take over if a primary server fails.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>21. What are sensors and collectors?</summary>
  - Sensors are detection tools like IDS.  
    Collectors (like SIEM tools) receive and analyze data from these sensors.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>22. What is a SIEM tool?</summary>
