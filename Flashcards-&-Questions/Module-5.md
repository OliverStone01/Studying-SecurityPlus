  This tells us how many times a risk might happen a year.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What does asset value (AV) mean?</summary>
  The amount something owned by the company is worth. This isn’t just the cost to replace the asset but also the total lost sales, fines, or other impacts.
</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is a risk register?</summary>
