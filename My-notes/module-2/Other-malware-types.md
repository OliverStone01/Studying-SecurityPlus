### Notes

A key logger is recording your key strokes and sending the information back to the attacker. 

Key loggers can also take other data like whatâ€™s in your clipboard, messages, and screenshots of your device.

A logic bomb is waiting before it runs an exploit or a script. It is waiting for an event, a specific time and day, or itâ€™s waiting for a user to do something like log in.

Logic bombs are difficult to identify because they donâ€™t have a known signature. You can protect against logic bombs by restricting the modification and creation of files. You can also set up monitoring on these files to be notified if something changes. 

A rootkit hides it self In the operating system and runs as the operating system making it very difficult to detect.

To protect against root kits we have UEFI in secure boot in the BIOS. This will look at the os signature making sure nothing has been changed before it is booted.
