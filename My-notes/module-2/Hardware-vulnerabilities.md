### Notes

Hardware devices that are connected to the network are are risk of being attacked. These devices may give attackers a way into your network.

Firmware is the software inside of the hardware.

Vendors are the only one that can ammend the firmware.

EOL = End of life.
EOSL = End of service life

EOL is issued to a system that will no longer be sold by the vendor.

EOSL is when the software will no longer be supported by the vendor.

Legacy platforms are devices that remain in use long after their EOSL.

When using legacy platforms, we need to add additional security devices/features to protect the network.
