### Notes

Most organisations are now using the cloud for their data and systems. The issue currently is 76% of organisations are not using MFA or management consoles making these very insecure.

Some attacks include:
- Authentication bypass
- Directory traversal
- Remote code execution
- Cross-site scripting
- Out of bounds write

Out of bounds write is when the attacker writes to areas that should be out of bound causing data to crash or code to be executed.
