### Notes

The supply chain is taking the raw materials and turning them into the final product which is then distibuted to distributors, customers, and consumers.

At any point during the supply chain, an attacker could infect the supply chain.

One exploit can infect the entire chain.

You can either control your own security or you can hire a thrid party to do this for you. Hiring a third party means that they have access to your network which means if they get hacked, then your network is also at risk.

To protect against this threat, companies will do audits.

For hardware providers, you can create trust by using small suppliers and having a good relationship with them. Other methods are strict controls over policies and procedures.

For software providers, its important that you check updates and patches and make sure you can trust the software. You also can use open source software as the source code is able to be read and checked for any malicious code.
