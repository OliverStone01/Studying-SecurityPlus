### Notes

An on path attack is when the attacker sits between the path of traffic between two devices.

This is commonly known as a man in the middle attack.

This is dangerous because the attacker cannot only see whatâ€™s being sent and receive, but they can also modify this data mean while the sender and receiver have no idea itâ€™s happening.

An example of an on path attack is ARP poisoning which takes place on a local IP subnet. This is because ARP does not encrypt or use any other security to protect the information going back a forward on the same subnet connection. 

An on-path browser attack is when the attacker is on the same device as the user. This is also known as a man in the browser attack. To do this, malware is setup like a proxy where any data sent or received is able to be redirected.

This attack can still be preformed if the network is encrypting the data because the attack is on the users device. 

This attack is used to capture login credentials that you may use to sign in to your bank or other accounts.
