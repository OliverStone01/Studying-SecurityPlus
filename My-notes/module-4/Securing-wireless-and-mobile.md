### Notes

If you are installing or working on a wireless network, it might be worth creating a site survey. This site survey will help you understand how your network is running and preforming.

This can also show you where other networks might be effecting your signal.

The site survey will identify the access points and will help find ways to tweak and improve your network.

Heat maps are a visual representation of this survey and will display signal strengths of connection. 

Other wireless survey tools also allow you to see:
- signal coverage
- Potential interference
- Built in tools
- Third party tools
- Spectrum analyser

For securing wireless devices, we use MDM (Mobile Device Management).

There are two types of mobile devices in an organisation:
- Company owned
- BYOD (bring your own device)

An MDM allows a technician to manage the devices at a centralised location. You can set specific functions like the camera not working when you are on site but it does once you leave the site. You could force a Lock Screen after the device has been inactive for a certain period of time. 

BYOD = Bring your own device
BYOT = Bring your own technology

The difficulty is when you need to make sure that the users data is secure and the companies data is secure.

COPE = corporate owned, personally enabled

COPE means that the device is owned by the organisation but it is used by employees for work and personal use. 

Organisations keep full control of the device.

CYOD = Choose your own device

This is still a cooperate owned device, but you the user is able to choose which device you would like.

Cellular networks work on 4g and 5g networks. The networks are spread out across the world. Each point is known as cells.

The three common security concerns with these devices is:
- traffic monitoring 
- Location tracking
- Worldwide access to a mobile device.

WI-FI has similar concerns which is why itâ€™s so important that you encrypt your data so that attackers who capture it cannot read or manipulate it. 

Bluetooth is high speed communication over short distances. Sometimes known as PAN (Personal Area Network)
