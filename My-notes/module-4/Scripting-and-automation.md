### Notes

Scripting and automation

Scripting is all about automation. Some scripts can detect and resolve problems before anyone even realises something was wrong.

The biggest benefit is speed and accuracy freeing IT staff to focus on more interesting work.

Automation can be used for:
- Patching: scripts that watch for new updates, then deploy them automatically across all systems.

- Configuration: New routers, firewalls, or servers can be set up with identical, secure configurations using scripts.

- Scaling in the cloud: As applications scale up with more servers and databases, scripts can also scale up the security.

- Monitoring: Scripts can check for low disk space, network issues, or service failures, then take action automatically.

- Onboarding/Offboarding: Automating user account creating, group assignment, and access provisioning makes hiring and termination faster and more secure.

- Guardrails: Scripts can verify inputs to prevent mistakes. For example, stopping a tech from accidentally deleting critical system files.

- Security group monitoring: Automation can alert admins if someone is added to the administrator group unexpectedly.

- Help desk integration: An incoming email can automatically generate a ticket, categorise it, and assign the right technician.

- Access Control: Scripts can be used to enable or disable services.

- DevOps & APIs: Scripts can be used to push code updates automatically or communicate with dece APIs to configure systems.

Scripts do have some drawbacks:
- Complexity: Scripts must be carefully coded and heavily tested to avoid creating bigger issues.

- Cost: Writing and maintaining scripts takes time and resources.

- Single point of failure: If a script breaks, the systems replying on it will fail.

- Technical debt: Scripts can sometimes mask deeper problems instead of fixing them.

- Ongoing support: Scripts need to be updated.
