### Notes

When purchasing goods in your organisation, there is a formal process that must be complete. This usually starts with a request from the end user who may need a new device or some software. This will then go through the different approval teams including management and IT. Once it has been agreed apron, the organisation will then negotiate a price with the suppliers and the terms and conditions of the purchase. Payments and vary from paying for the item on the spot, via an invoice that must be paid in 30 days, and in payment options where the organisation will pay in an agreed duration.

Once the good are received, they are tracked via a central tracking system that manages all the assets in the organisation. The device is the given ownership by which we mean we assign the device to the end user so that any changes we need to make to the delivery or tracking, we can make under the end users account/name. 

Classification is the process of determining what type of asset it is (Software/Hardware). 

With the centralised tracking system, we can take stock of all the devices. Help desk can also use this to help customers track their orders as it is saved under their name. Technicians may also use this to look for what they are working on when working on tickets. 

Inside the tracking system, we can track each part in the device which can be checked at any point.

Some organisations will also add asset tags like a barcode so that the device can be scanned to get the information. 

Media sanitisation is a process complete when we are getting rid of a device or passing the device to another user. We need to be sure that if we are getting rid of the device permanently, we remove all data from the drives and preform a whole disk wipe.

If the device is being given to someone else in the organisation, then only certain files and information will need to be removed from the device.

If we want to make sure the data can never been seen again is to physically destroy the drive. This can be done with a shredder or some other type of heavy machinery that would cause complete destruction.

A simple method is to use a drill or a hammer.

Degaussing is the use of an electromagnetic field that erases all data on the drive. 

A final way is via insinuation.

Some organisations get so many drives that need to be destroyed, they may hire a third party to destroy for you. 

Data retention would be keeping a backup for your system. Some organisations may be required to keep emails and corporate financial data.
