### Notes

Access Control is about enforcing policies that allow or deny access to data.

Access control can be applied to an individual or a group.

There are several models of access control, but across all the different types, the best practice is least privilege.

- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Every resource (file/folder) is assigned a label ranging from confidential, secret, top secret, etc. Each user is then assigned what level they are able to access.

- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): The owner of the data decides who gets access and what level.

- Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Access Is tied to job roles.

- Rule-based Access Control: Permissions are enforced by rules created by administrators.

- Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC): This is the next generation. It considers many attributes like IP address, time of the day, requested action, and relationship to the data.

Access controls ensures that after authentication, users only get to the data they need.
