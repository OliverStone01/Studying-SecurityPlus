### Notes

Attackers will be working 24/7 to attack your network. This is why itâ€™s so important to track your system at all times. To do this we can setup dashboards that allow us to monitor all the systems in one place. 

We can monitor our systems by looking at the authentication logs. If someone is trying to log into a US account from a different country, this may be an attacker. We also need to look at our applications and make sure they are constantly available and have no security notifications. 

We should also monitor our infrastructure by monitoring our remote access systems, Firewalls, and IPS (Intrusion prevention systems) reports.

When checking logs, we can use a SIEM (Security information and event manager) to check all the logs in a centralised database. This includes servers, firewalls, VPN concentrators, SANs, and cloud services.

Most organisations will be preforming active scanning on systems and devices to check for vulnerabilities.

Itâ€™s important to create reports on patches and vulnerabilities to help determine the next action to take. These are known as actionable reports. 

According to a IBM report in 2022, it takes an organisation around 9 months for a company to identify a breach. This is why itâ€™s a good idea to have a long term backup strategy is so important and some organisations may be bound by law to keep data. 

Alerting is the notification of a security event that is taking place. An alert might be setup to go off when there are large amounts of authentication errors or if a large file is transferred. 

Once an alert has been triggered, it is best to quarantine the system to prevent the attack spreading to other devices on the network. It is important to tune your alerting system to prevent false positives and false negatives.
