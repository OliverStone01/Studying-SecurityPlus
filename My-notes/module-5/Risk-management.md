### Notes

Every organisations faces risk. As the organisation grows, so do the risks. Risk management is the process of identifying assessing and addressing those risks before they become serious problems. Threats can come from inside or outside the organisation. Risk management helps to respond to these threats.

There are 5 ways to preform risk assessments:
- One-time assessments: These are specific risks for an events or project.
- Ongoing assessments: These are part of regular processes like change control.
- Ad hoc assessments: ad hoc means for this purpose only. These are triggered by specific concerns.
- Scheduled assessments: Running risk assessments on a fixed schedule.
- Mandated assessments: Required by law or regulation to carry out assessments.

Risk management ensures organisations understand where theyâ€™re vulnerable and have plans in place to minimise the impact of potential threats.
