### Notes

Security awareness is the act of training employees to spot security threats like phishing emails and have the information on what to do if they spot a threat.

We also train users to recognise anomalous behaviour (Things that dont look normal on their device):
- Risky actions: modifying a host file or uploading sensitive data.
- Unexpected activity: Logging on from another country or sudden spikes in data transfers.
- Unintentional mistakes: Mistyping a domain, losing a USB drive, or misconfiguring device security.

Catching these issues requires continues monitoring.

When these issues are found, the first step is user training.

The security awareness team will step in and build specialised training programs.
