### Notes

When working with a service provider, you want requirements written down.

A Service level agreement (SLA) spells out minimum performance levels like uptime guarantees, response times or how quickly a technician must be dispatched if something breaks.

If itâ€™s a new business relationship, you may begin with a Memorandum of understanding (MOU). This is informal version that outlines broad goals, maybe includes confidential statements but is not legally binding.

Above that are Memorandum of agreement (MOA). This adds more detail about how the organisations will work together. 

If the partnership is long term, you will probably create a Master Service Agreement (MSA). This is a formal legal contract that sets the framework for the entire relationship.

When a new project comes along, you donâ€™t need to renegotiate the MSA. Instead, you attach a Statement of Work (SOW). Sow is very specific including the scope, deadlines, and deliverables.

Sometimes the concern is confidentiality this is where a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This ensures sensitive information is kept protected. These are signed before any sensitive details are shared.

If the relationship involves shared ownership or revenue, you will use a Business Partners agreement (BPA). This defines financial details, ownership stakes, and decision-making authority. This also covers what happens when things go wrong.
