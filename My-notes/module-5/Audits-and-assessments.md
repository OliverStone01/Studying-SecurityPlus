### Notes

A cyber security audit is a deep look at our environment. This includes, the infrastructure, the software, the devices on the network, even the policies and procedures that guid how the organisation operates.

An audit can reveal weaknesses before an attacker finds them.

Audits do not have to be external and can also be done internally.

Attestation is the statement of truth tied to the audit results.

Internal Audits often start with a self-assessment. Departments review their own processes and check compliance with company and regulatory requirements. An Audit committee may over see this.

Some compliance rules demand that audits are done externally using a third-party.

At the end of the Audit, the results show us two things:
1. Where we stand today in terms of compliance.
2. Where we need to improve for the future.

Penetration tests

Penetration testing can be physical and digital.

In a physical penetration test, attackers try to break into your facility.

Penetration testing has two teams. Offensive (Red team) and Defensive (Blue team). The most effective cycle is using the red team to find weaknesses and blue patches them.

Different pen tests use different levels of knowledge:
- Known environment: Testers are given access to system details.
- Partially known: Testers get some of the information
- Unknown environment: Testers are blind and must find everything on their own.

Every test begins with reconnaissance. This is the process of gathering information about the systems and the organisation.

Reconnaissance comes In two forms:
- Passive: Gathering info without touching the network
- Active: Directly probing the network.

Penetration testing simulates real work attacks to help organisations patch these issues.
