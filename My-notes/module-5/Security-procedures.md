### Notes

Security procedures keep organisations consistent, safe, and accountable.

Change management is the procedure of defining a process before a change is made. This includes determining the scope, risk assessment, detailed plan, and approval. A change board will then usually review the proposal and the backup plan. This is then authorised and scheduled. Once the change has been made, it must be documented to prevent confusion, downtime and mistakes.

Onboarding is the process of adding a new employee by providing policies and acceptable use agreements, set up accounts with the current permissions, and issue devices to ensure they can work securely from day one.

The flip side of off boarding is when someone leaves. We must follow strict procedures to make sure all access is removed by disabling the account and all data is safely protected. 

A Playbook contains step-by-step guides for specific events like investigating a breach or responding to ransomware. Playbooks can be automated using SOAR (Security, Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms which tie different systems together, automate routine tasks, and free security staff to focus on bigger threats.

As technology and threats change, procedures must be reviewed and updated regularly.

Governance gives structure to all these processes. In many organisations, a board will set high level goals, while committees of subject experts figure out the details and report back.

Public sector governance differs with more legal, administrative, political considerations, and meetings with the public.

Governance can be centralised with a group making decisions for everyone. Or it can be decentralised with local teams making their own decisions.
