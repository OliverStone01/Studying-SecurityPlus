### Notes

Backups are one of the most important things in cyber security or IT. These allow you to revert to when your system was at a good point. This is great for combatting against ransomware or if your device breaks, you still have your data.

An onsite back-up is as it sounds. A back up located at the same site. This is useful for being able to secure the backup and for recovery time but it does mean that if anything happens to that site, you will lose your back up with your main system.

An offsite back up helps to protect data from natural disasters and theft from one site by keeping your backup at a second location.

Some organisations back up every hour, some every day, and some once a month. This all depends on what type of data you are storing and how important it is to the organisation. 

We need to think about keeping these backups safe with encryption. This means that if someone who is not authorised gets hold of these drives, they will not be able to see or use the information on the drives. 

Snapshot is a backup for a virtual machines and cloud-based infrastructures. A snapshot allows you to revert an entire system with one click of a button. 

Snapshots are a great way to backup data because it will only add the new data instead of saving the entire system over again.

It is not enough to just backup the data, you need to be able to restore to the backup. Itâ€™s important to simulate disaster situations and try to restore from a backup to make sure everything is working properly. 

Replication is an ongoing backup as it backs up in real time. This is great for making a hot site as the data will be up to date immediately.

Journaling allows you to prevent corrupt data when writing to memory. If the power goes out, the device will look at the last few backed up journals and find the missing data.
