### Notes

Gap analysis is the study of diffrence between where your security currently is and where you want your security to be.

You should set internal goals in your organisation known as a `Baseline`.

When setting a baseline, you need to evalute the emplyees and what their current experience is, current training they have taken, and knowledge of security policies and procedures.

You also need to examine the current IT processes and check their security policies.

When creating the Gap Analysis, we need to compare and evaluate existing systems, identify weaknesses, and create a detailed analysis of broad security categories and break them into smaller segments.

Once the analysis has been complete, we can create a final document displaying where weeknesses are and what we can do to get to where we want to be.
