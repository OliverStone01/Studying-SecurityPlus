### Notes

Bollards and barricades are used to prevent access and in other cases redirect people through specific access points. There barricades can be anything from concrete barriers to water features with a bridge.

Access control vestibules is the act of restricting access to areas when other areas are open. For example, when you have multiple doors that are usually unlocked and one access door that is locked. When the access door is unlocked, the other doors are locked to prevent multiple doors being open at once which restricts access.

Using these methods allows you to have a one at a time system and the ability to have control areas.

Fencing is a good way to prevent easy access to restricted areas. Although it may not be of much privacy or prevent all attackers from getting it. It is a good method of deterent and stops anyone walking into restricted areas.

Video surveilance are a good method of logging who has been in an area at any given time. But they are also good for monitoring areas and triggering alerts using motion detection to notify security. They can also be used for object detection like detecting a number plate or a persons face.

Security guards are a good method of physical protection who are able to validate identification. Guards usually work in pairs to minimise exposure to an attack and so that no single person has access to a physical asset. 

Access badges are used to identify people on site. This badge is visible to everyone using a lanyard that you wear. This badge can also be used to enter electronic doors which then is logged in a database that this person entered this room at this time.

Lighting is a good method of security as attacker will want to stay hidden to prevent being seen by cameras or sucurity guards. 

We can use motion detectors like Infrared motion detection that dont require light at all to detect motion. You can also use pressure sensor for detecting changes in the room or area.

If you wanted to check for motion over a large area, you might want to use microwaves instead of Infrared sensors.
