### Notes

Malware can avoid detection by placing itself between existing processes. This also allows the malware to get the same access as the process it has injected itself into.

One of the most common types of injection is DLL injecting (dynamic-link library) this is because most application can use this library. 

The attacker will link the path to the infected DLL on a storage device during the application run time.

DLL Injection - Dynamic-link library.
