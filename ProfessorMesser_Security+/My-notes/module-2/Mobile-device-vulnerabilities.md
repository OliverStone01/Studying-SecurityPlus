### Notes

Mobile devices are challenging to secure as they often need additional security policies and systems.

Mobile devices are small and can be hidden.

These devices are always moving making it harder to keep track of their movement.

These devices are also packed with sensitive information and they are mostly always connected to the network.

Mobile devices come with purpose-build systems and you do not have access to the operating system unless you `Jailbreak/root` the device. Android is rooting and Apple IOS is Jail breaking.

Jail breaking/rooting installs a custom operating system.

Apps are downloaded from managed and trusted sources like the app store. This is because the app stores are able to check for malicious code and will review the application before pushing to the app store.

Side loading is the act of downloading a application from outside of the app store. This comes with the risk of downloading applications with malware.
