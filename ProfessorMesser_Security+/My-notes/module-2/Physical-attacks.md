### Notes

Physical attacks mean to attack the system physically or an organisation physical assets.

Brute force usually means to attack password systems. But we can also use brute force to break down doors and other physical security systems.

RFID cloning is very common. RFID badges are used in key cards and fobs. These are really cheap and you can buy a cloning device online. The attack would need to get close to a badge, scan the information, and now they have access to the information on the card replicating it onto another card 

This is why MFA is so vital.

An environmental attack means to attack the physical environment around the device. For example, disabling the power to a building that you know contains the data centre.

The attacker doesnâ€™t need to get access to the building to do this.

Another physical attack would be to attack the cooling like air conditioning that is cooling the devices usually gets low security and if attacked the devices would overheat and shut down.

 The fire system may also be a weak point that can cause the system to shut down.
