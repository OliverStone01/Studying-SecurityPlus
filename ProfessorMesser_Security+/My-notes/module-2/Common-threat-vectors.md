### Notes

A threat vector is the method used by the attacker to gain access to your system.

Security professionals spend their career watching these vectors.

One of the biggest methods is messaging systems:
- Email
- SMS (Short message service)

A phishing attack is a message sent to someone that commonly contains a malicious link. These emails usually take advantage of social engineering to scam the victims.

Other threat vectors include:
- PDF files
- Image files
- HTML injection
- Javascript attack code

To protect against injection attacks, we must provide input validation.

Vishing is phishing over the phone.

Air gapped networks can be attacked using software installed on a USB device. The attacker does'nt need to get near the system, they can drop a few of these USB sticks in the carpark and wait to see if someone picks one up and plugs it in. 

Patching is an important method for keeping our systems up to date with the latest security patches. 

The network connects all your devices together so its important that all systems are updated and patched because the attacker would only need to gain access to one of those systems.

If your network is running outdated security protocols like WEP, WPA, WPA2. You need to consider upgrading to prevent attacks.

For wired connections, we can use the security feature No 802.1X. This means anyone trying to connect through a wired connection, they need to provide the correct credentials.

Bluetooth is also use in attacks for reconnaissance.

An open port is an opportunity for an attacker. Thats why we must use firewall rules to prevent any traffic from accessing our systems.

Its important to change the default values of credentials that come with devices as any attacker could get hold of this information.

Supply chains can also be attacked and the systems can be tampered with.

An MSP (managed service provider) looks after your devices and network. If an attacker takes over a MSP, they now have access to your systems.
