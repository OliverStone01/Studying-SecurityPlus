### Notes

Many applications have vulnerabilities in them that are yet to be found. These are called Zero-day vulnerabilities as the vendor has known about them for zero-days.

Researchers and attackers are always working to find the next big vulnerability.

Becuase the vendor does not know about the vulnerability, there are no patches.
