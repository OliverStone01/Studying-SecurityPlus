### Notes

A watering hole is a trap set by the attacker to try trap the victim when they visit the site. An attacker will first find a site that the victim uses often and find a way to set a trap on that site.

To prevent against watering whole attacks, we need to use a layered defense system. We also need to make sure we setup firewalls and IPs correctly.
