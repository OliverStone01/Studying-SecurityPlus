### Notes

Phising uses social engineering to make you believe something is real so that you give away sensitive information. For example, someone may send you an email saying that your account has been locked and to unlock your account, you must use this link to sign in. When the user clicks the link, they are taken to a site that looks like the real site, but i reality it is designed to steal your login information when you try to sign in.

To prevent being fooled, check the url as it will not be the real sites URL.

Spoofing means to change something slightly.

Make sure to check URLs for spoofing.

Typosquatting is the act of spoofing the URL slightly in an attempt to lure in victims who do not realise. For example, www.google.com is spoofed to www.goog1e.com.

Pretexting is where the attacker comes up with a fake event in order to trick you into giving over your sensitive data.

Vishing is the phishing over the phone

Smishing is phising over SMS
