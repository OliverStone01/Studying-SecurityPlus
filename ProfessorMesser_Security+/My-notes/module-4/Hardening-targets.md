### Notes

Most manufacturers will provide hardening guides for you to follow.

Mobile devices are a common device that needs to be hardened to keep secure. The updates are used to patch vulnerabilities found. 

You may find if your organisation gives you a mobile device, it will be segmented into a work device and a personal device so that an attacker does not get full access if they get in the them individually.

If you are managing mobile devices, you will most likely be using a MDM to deploy security patches.

MDM = Mobile Device Manager

Workstations also need hardening with updates/patches and possibly extra technology like a firewall. Itâ€™s is also worth removing any bloatware or unnecessary software from the device.

Our network infrastructure also needs hardening. But these devices donâ€™t usually run a generic operating system so you will be limited with what security you can add there.

One type of hardening is to change to default authentication passwords and other default options that an attacker could take advantage of.

Cloud infrastructures also need hardening. To do this, make sure the account and device that is the main admin is secure. Every part of the system that can be changed to least privilege should be changed.

You can also set up EDR (End point detection). This will monitor your cloud system. Itâ€™s also important to set up backups with C2C (Cloud 2 Cloud backup).

Servers need to be hardened with updates, firewalls, minimum password requirements, and monitor with anti-virus/anti-malware.

Embedded systems are also difficult to harden as they have their own operating system running in a purpose built device. Itâ€™s important to keep them up to date with the latest software updates

IOT (internet of things) usually have pretty bad security so itâ€™s important to keep an eye for patches that fix vulnerabilities.
