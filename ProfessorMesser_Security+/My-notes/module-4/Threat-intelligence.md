### Notes

It is important to keep up to date with the threat actors that threaten your organisation. There are tools that you can use to get more information about hacker groups and what techniques they are likely to use.

OSINT = Open source inteligence

This is open source public data and information that can tell you more about an attacker. This can be social media and discussion groups. The government also puts data on display such as public hearings, reports, and websites. 

Commercial data is data that has been released by an organisation. This may be maps, financial reports, and databases. 

Threat intelligence services are a third party that do your threat intelligence for you at a fee. This is good as it saves you time and resources and they will highlight the areas that need amending/patching to protect your organisation. 

Information sharing organisations will compile there threat intelligence data and give it to their customer to show how secure these companies are.

CTA = Cyber Threat Alliance

This alliance is where members can upload threat intelligence and the CTA will score the submission and other members can extract and validate the data. 

The dark web is a good place to get threat intelligence as this is where most hacker groups will post information and they may try to sell data here.
