### Notes

Out-of-bank key exchange is exchanging the key in person and not on the internet.

In-band key exchange is exchanging the key over the network. We can do this by using asymmetric encryption to deliver a symmetric key.

In-band key exchange is quick and it is commonly seen when sharing session keys. These keys must be discarded between use.

public and private key cryptography can be used to create a symmetric key by combing ones private key with someone elses public key. Once both users do this, you now have matching symmetric keys.

This is known as a key exchange algorithm.
