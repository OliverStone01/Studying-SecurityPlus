### Notes

The public key infrastructure refers to procedures, hardware and software that creates, distributes, manages, stores, and revokes digital certificates.

This also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices.

Symmetric encryption means to use the same key that encrypted the message to decrypt the message as well. This is sometimes referred to a `Secret key algorithm`. This usually runs into scalability errors.

Asymmetric encryption means to use two different keys. The private key and a public key. The private key is the only key that can decrypt data that is encrypted with the public key. 

As an example. If Bob wants to send Alice a message, he would encrypt the plain text message with Alice's public key and then he would send this encrypted data across the internet to Alice. Once Alice receives the data, she can decrypt the message using her private key.
