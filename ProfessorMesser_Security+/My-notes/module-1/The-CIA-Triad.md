### Notes

The CIA triad is an easy way to remeber the fundamentals of IT security. This is sometimes known as the AIC triad.

C = Confidentiality
- To prevent disclosure of information to unauthorised users or systems. We can do this is via Encryption, Access Controls (which restricts access to a resource for specific users) or Two Factor Authentication.

I = Integrity
- Messages cannot be modified without detection. We can insure integrity by Hashing the data when storing and retreaving the data to see if the hashes match. We can add a Digital Signature which is a mathmatical scheme to verify the data. We can use Certificates to verify the correct individual sent the data. Non-repudiation is the act of making sure that someone cannot later deny an action or message.

A = Availability
- To make sure all our systems and networks are always up and running. We can do this using redundancy which means to build systems that will always be running. We can do this using Fault tolerance which means to have extra componenets that can kick in if one fails. You will also need to be constantly patching the system by doing updates and closing security holes.
