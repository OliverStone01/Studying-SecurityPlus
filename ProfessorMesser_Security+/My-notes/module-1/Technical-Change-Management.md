### Notes

A technician is the one who will be preforming these upgrades.

A change to an allow/deny list is adding apps that the users within a company are able to use. This can be difficult as we will need to check for known vulnerabilities and the software may even be malware. We must insure we check and patch any issues before adding the apps to the list.

An allow list runs nothing unless it is approved.

A Deny list runs everything unless it has been added to the deny list.

Anti malware can be seen as a deny list as it allows you to run anything and denies any software it believes to be malware.

The scope of change must be followed. You will also receive a time frame to complete the change. It is important that you do not use this time to do other changes that have not been approved in this time frame.

Downtime is the time the system will not be available for. It is important that you update users that downtime will occur.

Its common to need to restart the system or device after an update or upgrade to implement the upgrade. 

Legacy applications are old applications that are are no longer supported by the developer. 

Dependencies are services or systems that rely on other systems or services. This might mean that we need to update another system before we upgrade this system.

It is important that you document and track changes to a file or configuration data over time. This makes it easier to revert changes and keep track of the systems configuration.
