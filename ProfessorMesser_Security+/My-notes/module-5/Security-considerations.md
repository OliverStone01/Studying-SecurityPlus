### Notes

IT security is not just technical, it is also legal and regulatory. Security professionals must understand the laws and standards that apply to their organisation and the data it collects.

Data isnâ€™t the only information that applications store, They also store logs. Some organisations may be required by law to keep this information for a set period of time.

HIPAA - Health insurance portability and accountability act

Legal responsibility can also be seen in reporting. IT teams must have procedures to report illegal activities and to preserve data under a legal hold for a court case. Many regions also require breach disclosure. This means if your organisation is compromised, you must inform regulators and possibly the public.

Cloud computing is complex because the data is stored all over the world. But some countries have laws about keeping data on its citizens inside of its borders. This makes data residency and compliance a critical part of operations.
