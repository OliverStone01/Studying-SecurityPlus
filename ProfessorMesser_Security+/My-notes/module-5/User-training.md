### Notes

Security training is the best practice and it is important to do before a user ever connects to the network.

Training isn’t a one size fits all and the training may n eed to be adjusted depending on what department and what their job role is.

Anyone who touches your systems must understand your security expectations.

Tracking is key and you should always know who has been trained, and who hasn’t. It’s important that everyone has a baseline of security awareness. Thats reinforced by documented policies.

Users also need situational awareness. They should be alert for phishing links in emails and sketchy URLS etc.

Users can also be the biggest risk. Spotting insider threats requires layers of control:
- Multiple approvals for critical changes
- File monitoring that alerts immediately when sensitive files are modified.
- Strong safeguards that make bypassing controls very different.

Password management is very important and users should be trained on password standards to keep their accounts secure. They should also be trained on the proper procedures to follow to prevent social engineering attacks. This might be that IT will never ask for your password over the phone or email. It’s also important that they are able to report these situations quickly. 

Remote work employees must never let family or friends use work systems. Endpoint security needs to be stronger for these devices and VPNS should come with strict controls.
