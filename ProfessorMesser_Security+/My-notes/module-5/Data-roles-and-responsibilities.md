### Notes

In an organisation, many people share responsibility for managing data.

At the top is the data owner. Data owners oversee all aspects of their data and take ultimate responsibility for its protection and use.

Next is the data controller and the data processor. The controller decides how the data will be used. The processor carries out the work. 

A data custodian (also called a data steward) ensures compliance with laws and regulations, security, and privacy of data. They often decide which users have access to specific data sets.
