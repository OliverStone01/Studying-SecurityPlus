### Notes

A cyber security audit is a deep look at our environment. This includes, the infrastructure, the software, the devices on the network, even the policies and procedures that guid how the organisation operates.

An audit can reveal weaknesses before an attacker finds them.

Audits do not have to be external and can also be done internally.

Attestation is the statement of truth tied to the audit results.

Internal Audits often start with a self-assessment. Departments review their own processes and check compliance with company and regulatory requirements. An Audit committee may over see this.

Some compliance rules demand that audits are done externally using a third-party.

At the end of the Audit, the results show us two things:
1. Where we stand today in terms of compliance.
2. Where we need to improve for the future.
