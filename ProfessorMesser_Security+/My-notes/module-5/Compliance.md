### Notes

Compliance Isnâ€™t just paperwork, itâ€™s the process of meeting required standards. These might come from government laws, industry regulations, or agreements youâ€™ve made with third parties. If you fail to comply, there are often serious penalties.

Every organisation has to track compliance at multiple levels:
- Local
- State
- Federal
- International

A Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) is appointed to oversee the process and report on the organisations compliance status.

Compliance is also external. If you are working with vendors or partners, you may have to meet their requirements and provide regular compliance reports. Missing deadlines or submitting inaccurate data may lead to sanctions.

Some examples of regulatory compliance.
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act): Ensures accurate financial reporting for public companies.
- HIPPA: Protects medical information in the U.S
- GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act): Governs how financial institutions safeguard customer data.

If you fail to comply with HIPPA, the fines can reach up to Â£50,000 and one year in prison. If violations are intentional or malicious, those penalties jump to Â£100,000 and 5 years in prison.

Compliance isnâ€™t just amount money and jail time. Thereâ€™s also reputation damage, loss of licences, loss of partnerships, and loss of future contacts.

Due care means youâ€™re responsible for managing compliance inside your company.
Due diligence means youâ€™re properly vetting and managing third-party compliance.

Attestation and acknowledgment is executives have to sign off on compliance status. Because they are accountable for ensuring the company is in good standing.

Compliance monitoring can now be automated to generate reports with live data.
