### Notes

If you share data with a third party like a vendor. You are taking on risk, especially if the data is sensitive.

The goal is to understand exactly how vendors are handing and protecting your data. These expectations are written in the contract.

Penetration testing is when a pen tester attempts to exploit weaknesses.

Contracts often include a right to audit clause. This means your organisation can preform regular audits on the vendors security controls. Audits can cover access management, password security, VPN controls, off-boarding processes and much more.

We must also look at the supply chain. Looking at all the risks as the raw materials are turned into the final product.

Sometimes it helps to bring in an independent assessor. They are able to see pattens across many organisations and can highlight risks you may have missed.

The process of investigating a company before doing business is known as due diligence.

We also need to watch for conflicts of interest.

Assessment isnâ€™t a one time event. Once the contract is signed, you need ongoing monitoring. All of this data is fed back into your vendors Risk profile.
