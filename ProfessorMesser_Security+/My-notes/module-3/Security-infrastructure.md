### Notes

Every network is slightly different, But there are also things that you will find on every network.

Firewalls help us separate trusted and untrusted data and users. We may also use other security tool and systems like honeypots, jump servers, load balancers, and sensors. 

A security zone allows us to separate areas of our network for specific things. We can have many different types of zones from trusted to untrusted, internal and external, inside, internet, servers, databases, and screened. This simplifies security policies for each zone.

The attack surface is the different ways the attacker can get into your systems. Our goal in security is to minimise the size of the attack surface. 

When securing connectivity, its important that check who is coming onto our network, we must protect cables from being damaged, add application-level encryption so if the attack does mange to capture packets, they are all encrypted. Finally, we must also use network-level encryptions like VPNs for anyone trying to get access to the network away from its location.
