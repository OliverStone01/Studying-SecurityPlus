### Notes

Data at rest is data stored on a storage device. Data at rest can be either encrypted on not encrypted.

Data in transit is data moving over the network. If this data is not encrypted, it has a high change of being accessed and read by anyone. Some of the encryption technologies include TLS (Transport layer security) (encrypts going back and forward to a web server) and IPsec (Internet protocol security) (encrypts all data over the network using a VPN).

Firewalls and IPS are ways to protect devices from receiving malicious data over the network. 

Data in use is data that your device is currently using. This data is processed in memory (RAM) and manipulated and processed using the CPU.

Data in use is usually not encrypted or in a non encrypted form of the data.

Data sovereignty is data that resides in a country is subject to the laws of that country. Laws may prohibit where data is able to be stored. For example, the GDPR (general data protection regulation) states that any data taken from a EU citizen must be stored in the EU.

Geolocation uses multiple different types of technology to find where someone is located.

This can be seen with streaming providers where unless you are in a specify country you are unable to watch specific programs or movies. 

This can also be used to control the level of control that a user has on a site.
