### Notes

This is the testing of what you and the organisation will do if a disaster occurs. To do this test, we need to make sure we are not effecting the organisation itself and we define rules to prevent this from happening.

We then need to evaluate and make changes and test again to make sure that you have the best plan possible.

Recovery testing can be costly and time consuming if you have to send people and hardware to a recovery site.

We can minimise this cost by doing a Tabletop exercise. This is where you go through the steps you would take by speaking your parts instead of physically doing them. 

A fail over test is the testing of backup systems to make sure that the system will swap to the backup devices and to make sure everything is running smoothly. 

We can also test the organisation with simulations. This can be testing phishing attacks, password requests, and data breaches to see what the system does. We must test users on phishing attack to make sure that the user understands not to click the link and to make sure that the internal security system is blocking those emails. 

Parallel processing is using a CPU that has multiple cores or a device with multiple CPUs to run two processes at once.
