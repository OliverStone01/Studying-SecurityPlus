### Notes

Power is the foundation of technology so it is important that you have a plan for outages. Most organisations do not make their own power and rely on third parties. This means we cannot control the power availability.

UPS = Uninterruptible Power Supply

A UPS gives you short term backup power. This is good for blackouts, brownouts (drop in voltage), and surges (high charge in voltage). This device uses batteries to store power.

There are three types of UPS:
- Offline/Standby UPS
- Line-interactive UPS
- On-line/Double-conversion UPS

You are able to choose what the battery capacity is for the UPS.

Generators can be used as long term power backup. Generators use fuel to generate power. Some are large enough to power an entire building and some will only be able to handle a few outlets.
