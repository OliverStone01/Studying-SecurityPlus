### Chapter 1: Today's Security Professional

Security professionals are responsible for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information used by their organisations. This requires a strong understanding of the threat environment facing their organisation and a commitment to designing and implementing controls capable of dealing with those threats.

**Cybersecurity Objectives**

The three key objectives of cybersecurity programs are **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.

Confidentiality ensures that unauthorised individuals are unable to gain access to sensitive information. This can be done with firewalls, access control lists, and encryption.

Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorised modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally. **integrity controls** include hashing and integrity monitoring solutions. Integrity threats may come from attackers trying to alter information without authorisation but it can also come from nonmalicious sources, like a power spoke causing the corruption of information.

Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users when they request them. **Availability controls** include fault tolerance, clustering, and backups. Availability threats may come from attackers trying to disrupt access or nonmalicious sources like a fire destroying a datacenter.

These three key objectives are known as the CIA Triad.

Nonrepudiation means that someone who performs an action cannot later deny having taken that action.

> Exam Note:  
The main components of the CIA triad are **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. Also know that nonrepudiation is the assurance that someone cannot later deny doing something.

**Data Breach Risks**

Security incidents occur when an organisation experiences a breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. These incidents may occur as the result of malicious activity or as the result of accidental activity.

A security professional is responsible for understanding these risks and implementing controls designed to manage those risks to an acceptable level. To do so, you must first understand the effects that a breach might have on your organisation and the impact it might have going forward.

**The DAD Triad**

The DAD triad explains the three key threats to cybersecurity efforts: Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial. 

Disclosure is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorised individuals. Known as **data loss**. This is a breach of confidentiality. Attackers who gain access to sensitive information and remove it from the organisation are performing **data exfiltration. Accidental disclosure can also occur if an admin misconfigures access controls or an employee loses a device.

Alteration is the unauthorised modification of information. This is a breach of integrity. Attackers may try to modify financial records for financial gain. Alteration may also occur as the result of **natural activity** like a power surge causing a bit flip that modifies stored data.

Denial is the disruption of an authorised user's legitimate access to information. This is a breach of availability. Denial can occur when an attacker launches a distributed denial of service (DDos) attack or as the result of accidental or natural activity.

Whenever you find yourself tasked with assessing the security controls used to protect an asset or the threats to an organisation, you can use the ****CIA** and **DAD** triads for guidance.

If you are asked to assess the threats to an organisation, you can use the DAD triad to as part of your analysis:
- Does the site contain sensitive information that would damage the organisation if disclosed to unauthorised individuals?
- If an attacker were able to modify information on the site, would this action cause financial, reputational, or operational damages to the organisation?
- Does the website perform mission-critical activities that could damage the business if an attacker disrupted the site?

**Breach Impact**

We can categorise the potential impact of a security incident by the following categories:  
- **Financial risk:** The risk of monetary damages to the organisation as the result of a data breach. This may be a direct financial damage (Cost to rebuild) or indirect (Competitors getting plans and beating the organisation to market).
- **Reputational Risk:** This is when negative publicity causes the loss of goodwill among customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
- **Strategic Risk:** The risk that an organisation will become less effective in meeting its major goals and objectives.
- **Operational Risk:** Is the risk the organisations ability to carry out its day-to-day functions.
- **Compliance Risk:** This occurs when a security breach causes an organisation to run afoul of legal or regulatory requirements.

Risks often cross categories and you should'nt feel the need to shoehorn every risk into one category.

**Identity theft**
If a data breach occurs, the most common 

**Implementing Security Controls**
Technical and business leaders will express the level of protection requirements by writing the control objectives that the organisation wishes to achieve. Security controls are specific measures that fulfill the security objectives of an organisation.

**Gap analysis**
During a gap analysis, the cybersecurity professonal reviews the control objectives and then examines the control designed to achieve those objectives. If there are any cases where the controls do not meet the control objective, this is a gap. These gaps should be treated as potential risks and remediated as time and resources permit.

**Security Control categories**

Security controls are categorised based on the way they achieve their objectives. Here are the four different categories:
- **Technical controls** are digital controls such as firewall rules, access control lists, intrusion prevention systems, and encryption.
- **Operational controls** are controls used to manage technology in a secure manaer. This includes user access reviews, log monitoring, and vulnerability management.
- **Managerial controls** are procedures that focus on the risk management process. This includes, periodic risk assesments, security planning excercises, and incorperation of security into the organisations change management.
- **Physical controls** are controls that impact the physical world. for example, fences, lighting, and alarms.
