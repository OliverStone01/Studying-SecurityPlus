### Chapter 1: Today's Security Professional

Security professionals are responsible for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and informations used by their organisations. This requires a strong understanding of the threat enviroment facing their organisation and a commitment to design and implementing controls capable of dealing with those threats.

**Cybersecuirty Objectives**

The three key objectives of cybersecurity programs are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Confidentiallity ensures that unauthorised individuals are unable to gain access to sensitive information. Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorised modifications to information or systems. Availability ensures that information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users.

These three key objectives are known as the CIA Triad.

Nonrepudiation means that someone who preforms an action can not later deny having taken that action.

> Exam Note:  
The main components of the CIA triad are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Also know that nonrepudiation is the assurance that someone cannot later deny doing something.

**Data Breach Risks**

Security incidents occur when an organisation experiences a breach of the CIA Triad. These incidents may occur as the result of malicious activity or as the result of accidental activity.

A security professional is responsible for understanding these risks and implementing controls designed to manage those risks to an acceptable level. To do so, you must first understand the effects that a breach might have on your organisation and the impact it might have going forward.

**The DAD Triad**

The DAD triad explains the three key threats to cybersecurity efforts: Disclosure, Alteration, and Denial. Disclosure is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorised individuals. This is also known as data loss.Alteration is the unauthorised modification of information and is a violation of the principle of integrity. Denial is the disruption of an authorised user'slegitimate access to information.

Whenever you find yourself tasked with assessing the security controls used to protect an asset or the threats to an organisation, you can use the CIA and DAD triads for guidance. 

**Breach Impact**

We can categorise the potential impact of a security incident by these categories:
- **Financial risk:** The risk of monetary damages to the organisation as the result of a data breach. This may be a direct financial damage (Cost to rebuild) or indirect (Competitors getting plans and beating the organisation to market).
- **Reputational Risk:** This is when negative publicity causes the loss of goodwill among customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
- **Strategic Risk:** The risk that an organisation will become less effective in meeting its major goals and objectives.
- **Operational Risk:** Is the risk the organisations ability to carry out its day-to-day functions.
- **Compliance Risk:** This occurs when a security breach causes an organisation to run afoul of legal or regulatory requirements.

Risks often cross categories and you shouldnt feel the need to shoehorn every risk into one categorie.

**Implementing Security Controls**
Technical and business leaders will express the level of protection requirements by writing the control objectives that the organisation wishes to achieve. Security controls are specific measures that fulfill the security objectives of an organisation.

**Gap analysis**
During a gap analysis, the cybersecurity professonal reviews the control objectives and then examines the control designed to achieve those objectives. If there are any cases where the controls do not meet the control objective, this is a gap. These gaps should be treated as potential risks and remediated as time and resources permit.
