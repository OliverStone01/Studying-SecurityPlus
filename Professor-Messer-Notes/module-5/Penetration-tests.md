### Notes


Penetration testing can be physical and digital.

In a physical penetration test, attackers try to break into your facility.

Penetration testing has two teams. Offensive (Red team) and Defensive (Blue team). The most effective cycle is using the red team to find weaknesses and blue patches them.

Different pen tests use different levels of knowledge:
- Known environment: Testers are given access to system details.
- Partially known: Testers get some of the information
- Unknown environment: Testers are blind and must find everything on their own.

Every test begins with reconnaissance. This is the process of gathering information about the systems and the organisation.

Reconnaissance comes In two forms:
- Passive: Gathering info without touching the network
- Active: Directly probing the network.

Penetration testing simulates real work attacks to help organisations patch these issues.
