### Notes


Organisations face risks every day and there are a few different strategies they can use to deal with them.

Risk transfer is handing off the risk to someone else. This could be by buying cybersecurity insurance. The financial impact of a breach is covered by the insurance provider instead.

Risk acceptance is when the organisations looks and understands the risks and decides to live with the risks. This might mean creating exemptions or exceptions to policies.

Risk avoidance means you remove the risk entirely leaving nothing left to manage.

Risk mitigation is where you reduce the risk to a safer level. This might be something like using a firewall.

Most organisations will come across dozens, if not hundreds or risks. This is where risk reporting is used to document all known risks, it describes how theyâ€™re being handled, and keeps leadership informed.

The report is important for upper management as they are the ones making the business decisions on budgets and strategy.
