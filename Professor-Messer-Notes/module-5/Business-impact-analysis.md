### Notes

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum acceptable time it should take to get critical systems operational again.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is how much data you can afford to lose and still function.

Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) is the average time it takes to fully fix a problem. This includes diagnosing the issue, getting replacement parts, installing them, and configuring. 

Mean Time Between failures or MTBF is a prediction of how long equipment will run before failing again. To calculate this, you take the total uptime of the system and divide it by the number of breakdowns.
