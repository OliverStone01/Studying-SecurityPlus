### Notes

Organisations collect massive amounts of data every single day. With this data comes a lot of responsibility.

Privacy regulation can begin at the local or state level.

GDPR is a European regulator that covers things like your name, address, photos, emails, bank details, and social media posts. If you want your data removed, you have the right to be forgotten, and organisations are legally required to comply.

Under GDPR, a data subject is any identifiable person.

Here are the roles inside an organisation:
- The data owner has ultimate responsibility (VP of sales owns customer relationship data)
- The data controller decides how the data will be used.
- The data processor caries out that usage.


A Data inventory tracks what data is collected, who owns it, how often itâ€™s updated, and in what format.
