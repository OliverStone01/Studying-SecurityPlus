### Notes

In technology, we depend on standards which tell us the formal, documented way to handle situations. They define requirements, reduce risk, and give consistency.

Some companies will write their own standards when their needs are unique. Others adopt well known frameworks like ISO from the international Organisation for standardisation or NIST, the national institute of standards and technology.

One area where standards are critical is passwords. Every organisation must decide what makes a strong password. This may include length, complexity, how often it is changed, and how it is stored.

Standards might also define acceptable authentication methods, rules for secure password resets, and approved password managers. 

Once a user is authenticated, access control standards define who gets to see what. You may need management approval before granting access and users may need to be trained before viewing sensitive data. 

There must be clear standards for removing access when contracts expire, employees leave, or when accounts are no longer valid.

Standards also extend into physical security. This could be requiring ID badges for everyone entering the area/building, different rules for staff and employees, electronic/biometric locks, or constant monitoring.

Encryption standards are how organisations are using encryption.

Standards guid everything to ensure security practices are not random but are consistent, documented, and reliable.
