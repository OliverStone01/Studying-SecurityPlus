### Notes

An attacker may use many different types of techniques to exploit your system:
- social engineering 
- Default credentials
- Misconfiguration

These attacks may require some prior knowledge about you or your system but are not very technical attacks.

Malicious code is varied from executable code to macro viruses and worms.

To protect against these attacks:
- Use anti-malware
- Use a Firewall
- Make sure your systems are updated and patched
- Train and use secure computing habits.
