### Notes

A buffer overflow attack is when an attacker writes more than what is expected into an area of memory this causes the access data to write into other data.

Developers need to preform bounds checking to prevent this attack from happening.

This exploit is very difficult as it can cause the application to crash so it takes a lot of time to get right.
