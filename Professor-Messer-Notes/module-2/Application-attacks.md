### Notes

A code injection is the easiest way to attack applications because they are adding their own data into the system.

This usually only occurs with bad programming.

A buffer overflow is also another method that an attacker can use to get their code to spill into other areas of memory.

To prevent this, make sure you are validating inputs.

Replay attacks take information passing between the server and device and replay the information later to the server to gain access. 

Privilege escalation is when an attack finds a way to gain access to admin privileges. 

Cross site request attacks takes advantage of the trust between browser and the web server and makes requests to the web server. 

A directory traversal allows attacker to read and write files to a web server. Here they can inject malicious code and get access to other information.
