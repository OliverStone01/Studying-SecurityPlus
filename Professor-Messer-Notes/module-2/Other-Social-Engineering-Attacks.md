### Notes

The sharing of misinformation can influence campaigns and social issues. Nation state hackers could use this to divide, distract, and persuade people.

The attacker will usualy create fake users to create content and post it to social media. The attacker will then amplify this post with ads and taking advantage of the social media algorithm. 

An attacker may use brand impersonation to pretend to be big brands to make the spread of misinformation have a larger impact.
