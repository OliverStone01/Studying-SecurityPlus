### Notes

Malware describes any software that is doing bad things to your system. 

Malware could be:
- recording your keystrokes (Keylogger)
- show advertising
- viruse
- worms
- encrypt your data for a fee (Ransomware).
- malware hidden as software you want (trojan horse)
- Rootkit
- Spyware
- Bloatware
- Logic bomb

You can get malware by running a program by clicking links, webpage pop-ups, drive-by download, and a worm.

Its important to have a good backup becuase if your files get encrypted via ransomeware, you can restore to a good backup without paying the attackers.
