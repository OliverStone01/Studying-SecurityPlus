### Notes

Denial of service occurs when an attacker forces a service to fail, prevent access to the service. 

This can be done by either overloading the system with requests or taking advantage of a known vulnerability on that site/system.

This is sometimes done by competitors to take the competition offline.

The denial of service may also only be a smoke screen to what is taking place in the rest of the organisation.

These attacks do not need to be advanced, they can also be done by just turning off the power to the server/system.

Sometime we accidentally do this to our selves by crashing the network or using up so much system power, it crashes the system. 

Bad planning can also cause this, for example running a waterline above the server and then the waterline breaks and floods the device.

DDOS = Distributed Denial of Service

DDOS is the act of taking an army of devices and using them to overload the system with requests causing the service to crash.

To create this army of devices, the attacker will create  bot net. A botnet is a devices that have been taken over using malware and the attacker can program them to complete tasks and scripts at a request. 

These are sometimes known as an asymmetric attack.

Some of the protocols that DDOS attacks take advantage of are NTP, DNS, and ICMP.

The attacker must find an insecure open DNS resolvers. By using amplification, this one command of requesting something on the website spread to all of the botnet can amplify into a large amount of requests.
