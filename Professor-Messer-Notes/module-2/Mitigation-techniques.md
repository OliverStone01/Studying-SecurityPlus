### Notes

Mitigation is the process of reducing the impact or potential impact of an attack.

Patching will help keep your devices more secure by being up to date on the latest security updates.

Another method of protection is by encrypting data at rest.

If the device is leaving the building, it is best to have a full disk encryption incase the device is stolen.

Another method for protection is setting up monitoring on the device and integrate with monitoring software from servers, switches, routers, and firewalls. 

Least privilege is another way to protect systems. This means that users only have access to what they need preventing the account from falling into the wrong hands with access to admin controls.

A posture assessment is preformed when a new device is added to check the level of security (firewall, EDR, and certificate status) and the operating system running on the device. If the system is out of compliance then it may be quarantined until the change/updates have been made.

Decommissioning a device needs to be done in a formal process. This is to prevent any data and information from being leaked.
