### Notes

A threat actor is the entity that causes the event that has an impact on the safety of another entiry. We also call these a malicious actor.

Its helpful to know who the attacker is during an attack becuase it allows you to understand why the attack is happening and whether it is a directed or random attack.

There are internal and external attackers. Internal attackers could be employees. 

Resources and funding is another way to characterise an attacker. If they have no money then they have limited access to resources or they may have extensive funding like a goverment hacker who will have unlimited resources.

Its also good to know the level of sophistication/capability of an attacker. 

Some motivations for attacks can be:
- Data exfiltration
- Espionage
- Service disruption
- Blackmail
- Financial gain
- Philosophical/political beliefs
- Ethical
- Revenge
- Disruption/chaos
- War

Here are some attacker types and their motivations:

#### Nation state hacker

- External entity

These hackers are goverment run. They may have many diffrent motivations from Data exfiltration, Philosophical, revenge, disruption, war.

Goverments have massive amounts of resources which means they can have constant attacks.

APT - Advanced Persistent Threat

These attackers can be highly sophisticated.

-----

#### Unskilled attackers

Runs pre-made scripts without any knowledge of whats really happening.

These attackers are usually motivated by the attack its self.

These attackers can be internal or external and they are not usualy very sophisitcated as they have limited resources.
