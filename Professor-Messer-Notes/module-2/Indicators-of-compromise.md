### Notes

IOC - indicator of compromise

Some indicators are:
- unusual amount of network activity
- Change to file hash values
- Irregular international traffic (checking the login logs)
- Changes to DNS data
- Uncommon login patterns
- Account lockout due to incorrect password
- Account locked so the attacker can social engineer the help desk
- Disabled updates to prevent vulnerabilities being patched

Usually the first sign of compromise is high amounts of unusual network traffic.
