### Notes

A wireless deauthentication attack is when an attacker preforms a Dos attack that removes everyone from a wireless network.

The main vulnerability here is the frames passed between the device and the access point. This would happen because early versions of wireless standards were not encrypted and didnâ€™t need authentication or validation.

IEEE noticed this and updated on version 802.11ac. This update encrypted all frames. 

Another method of preventing someone from access to a network is using Radio frequency jamming. 

This works by the attacker sending out radio frequencies to everyone in the area. This causes lots of noise in the area and the devices will begin to find more noise than packets to the network. This will cause slow connections and even disconnect users from the network.

Microwaves and fluorescent lights can have a similar effect to 2.4ghz network connections.

The attacker could send constant, random, or legitimate frames to cause this to happen.

These attacks have to be close proximity. Finding these attackers can be called a fox hunt. 

To detect where the attack is, you can use a directional antenna and a attenuator to help listen and find where the noise is coming from.
