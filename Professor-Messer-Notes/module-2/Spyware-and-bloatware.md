### Notes

Spyware is malware that spies on you by watching everything that happens on your device.

It uses this information to advertise to you, for identity theft, and for affiliate fraud.

This malware can be installed by tricking the user via a link or by using a Trojan horse attack.

The spyware may also install a key logger on your system.

As long as you are maintaining and updating your anti-virus/anti-malware software, these will always be looking for spyware that is running on your device and will disable and prevent the spyware from working.

Itâ€™s also important that you use trusted sources to download software on your device.

Malware can be difficult to uninstall so itâ€™s best to have a good backup that you can revert to.

Bloatware is the software that comes with your device.

Bloatware apps can be paying manufacturers to put their app on the devices.

Bloatware could be causing issues on your device by using more resources, slowing down the device, and also increase the likelihood of a vulnerability on your device 

Bloatware can quite difficult to install depending if the manufacturer allows you to uninstall it using the built in uninstaller. There is also third party uninstaller software, but this is the last hope option.
