### Notes

One of the most valuable things to a company is its data. This is why itâ€™s so important to keep it secure. 

Regulated data means a thirds party sets the rules of how this data should be managed and stored. These rules are government laws and 

An example is credit card data must be compliant with the payment card industry standards.

Trade secrets are secret formulas held by an organisation. These are often unique to each organisation. Other companies and organisations would love to get hold of this information as it could put them ahead of the competition.

Intellectual property may be publicly visible but is protected from being copied and used without permission using Copyright and Trademark restrictions.

Legal information can fall into both categories where some documentation like court records needs to be made public and other sensitive information needs to kept private. These are usually stored in two different systems to prevent a data leak. 

Financial information would classify as sensitive information and will need to be kept confidential.  This includes your banking information.

Human-readable means the data is stored in plain text and can be read by any human that understands the language it is written in.

Non-human-readable would be something barcodes and encoded data. This data is stored in a way that a human canâ€™t easily read or understand.

Some data types are a hybrid of both human readable and non-human readable. For example, CSV, XML, JSON, etc. a barcode for example has the numbers written below making it a hybrid. 

Different data has different levels of classification and sensitivity. For example, a number plate holds access to your details and details about your car but this information is accessible. Medical records on the other hand should not be accessed by anyone without the correct permissions.
