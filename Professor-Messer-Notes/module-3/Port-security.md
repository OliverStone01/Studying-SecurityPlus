### Notes

Port security refers to the security on the individual interfaces that are on a switch or a wireless access point.

The EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) is what allows us to use port security. This framework allows authentication on network devices. EAP is able to integrate with 802.1X which is a IEEE standard that manages the authentication process for the user an devices.

IEEE 802.1X is sometimes known as NAC (Port-based network access control). This standard prevents access to the network until the authentication is successful.

There is usually three devices involved:
Supplicant - The client
Authenticator - The device that provides access 
Authentication server - Validates the clients credentials
