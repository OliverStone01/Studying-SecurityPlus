### Notes

Itâ€™s important to find the right amount of supply to the demand you are going to get on your service or site. This means that you are not over paying for resources you are not using. Itâ€™s also important that you have enough resources so that the site doesnâ€™t crash and cant keep up with demand.

Itâ€™s important that we look at the amount of staff we have and that we look at what technology we are using to make sure that we can scale as needed.
