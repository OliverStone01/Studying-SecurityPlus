### Notes

When making a change in the software whether that be via an update to a program or patching a system issue. It is important that you have a formal change control process of completing these updates and patches to have the least impact to the buisness/company.

It is also important to have clear policies so that if you need to rollback an update incase of issues, there is a clear plan and process.

1. Complete the request form
2. Document the reason for the change
3. Identify the scope of the change
4. Schedule a date and time of the change
5. Analyse the risk of the change
6. Get approval from the change control board
7. Get end-user acceptance and check for issues.

The stakeholders are the ones impacted by the change so they may want to have an input on the change management process.

When analysing risk, you have to look all minor and far reaching risks and we also have to look at what the risks are of not making the change.

You can test the processes and how the systems will react in a `sandbox` enviroment which is not connected to the production system and will not impact the buisness if it goes wrong.

You can also use this to test your backout procedures by upgrading the system and then reversing the upgrade.

A backout plan is a plan on how to revert back to a previous state. We can do this using backups.
