### Notes

A blockchain is a distributed ledger used for keeping track of transactions.

Everyone on the blockchain network maintains and keeps a record of this ledger.

We can use blockchains for
- Payment processing
- Digital identification
- Supply chain monitoring
- Digital voting

When a transaction is processed, the transaction is sent to everyone on the blockchain updating everyones ledger.
