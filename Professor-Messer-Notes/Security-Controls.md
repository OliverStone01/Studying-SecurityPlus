### Notes

Control categories:

Techinical Controls:
Using software to control what functions can and cannot happen on a system. This ranges from firewalls to block data leaving or entering a system/network to using `operating system controls` to prevent users accessing certain data and functions.

Managerial Controls:
Implmenting security designs and security policies that staff and users must be trainned on and adhear to as a standard operating procedure for keeping data safe. 

Operational Controls:
Using people for control and security. Such as security guards, awareness programs, and posters informing staff how to keep data safe.

Physical Controls:
Physical security measures to prevent physical access such fences, locks, badge readers, and bollards.

Control Types:

Preventive Control:
Prevents access to a specific resource such as a firewall, security policies, locked doors, and guards checking ID to verfiy authorisation.

- Technical Control: Firewall
- Managerial Control: Security policy
- Operational Control: Guard shack
- Physical Control: Locked door


Deterrent Control:
Tries to discourage an attacker or an intrusion attempt. For example, a splash screen, threat of demotion, front reception, warning signs.

- Technical Control: Splash screen (Warning screen)
- Managerial Control: Threat of demotion
- Operational Control: Reception desk
- Physical Control: Warning signs

Detective Control:
These controls may not prevent an attack or access but they are able to identify when an intrusion has accured or been attempted and log the neccesary data.

- Technical Control: Collect and review system logs
- Managerial Control: Review login reports
- Operational Control: Regularly patrol of the property
- Physical Control: Motion detectors

Corrective Control:
This control is used after an event has taken place to try reverse the impact of the event or continue operations with minimal downtime.

- Technical Control: Restoring from a backup
- Managerial Control: Create policies for reporting security issus
- Operational Control: Contacting law enforcement
- Physical Control: Fire extinguishers.

Compensating Control:
This envolves using temporary solutions until you are able to fix the issue perminantly.

- Technical Control: Firewall blocking instead of patching the issue.
- Managerial Control: seperation of duties.
- Operational Control: simulatanieous guard duties
- Physical Control: generator to keep systems running.

Directive Control:
This is where you inform and direct people on how to be more secure. This is a very week security control.

- Technical Control: Store sensitive files in a protected folder
- Managerial Control: Create compliance policies and procedures
- Operational Control: Train users on proper security policies.
- Physical Control: a sign on a door saying "Authorised personnel only"


It is important to note that some organisations may cobine types of controls and some security controls may exist in diffrent categories and types.
