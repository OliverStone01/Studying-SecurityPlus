### Notes

Organisations are advised to test their readiness to check how well the response plan is documented and how skilled the team is at executing it.

These tests must run on non-production systems. Time is limited so exercises must be structured and efficient.

After each test, teams hold a review session to evaluate performance.

There are two types of tests:
- Tabletop exercises: Teams gather around a table and walk through a hypothetical incident step by step. No systems are disrupted, but processes and responsibilities are clarified. This can be done quickly and can reveal weaknesses.

- Simulations: These mimic real attacks. For example, a phishing campaign might be sent to employees to see who clicks. The goal is to uncover weaknesses in detection, monitoring, and user behaviour.

Simulations often reveal two things. Whether technical systems like span filter and anti-phishing protections are working, and whether employees can spot and avoid traps.

Incident planning involves root cause analysis. An attack may begin with a single vulnerability, but attackers often chain multiple steps.

Sometimes the cause can be human error. Social engineering is a large part of gaining access to systems without needing to find a vulnerability in the software.

Threat hunting is actively looking for vulnerabilities before attackers find them.

This is why automation and monitoring tools are vital as they can identify patterns of attacks and stop them.
