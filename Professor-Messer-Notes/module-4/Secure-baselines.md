### Notes

A security baseline is the best practices for each application and device. Itâ€™s important to meet this baseline before the application or device is deployed.

This baseline might be adding firewalls, different patch settings, etc.

If the baseline is not met, a plan must be put in place to recorrect this immediately.

Many manufacturers will have a baseline for each device and application, you can adjust these as needed. 

You may be able to deploy via one admin console, or you may need to deploy individual systems depending on what is necessary. 

You may need to go back and edit or add to the baseline depending on if the vulnerabilities are found.

You may also find that 2 manufacturers have opposing baselines and you may have decide which is the better baseline.
