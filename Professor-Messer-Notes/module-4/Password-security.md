### Notes

The goal of making a password is to make it hard to guess. This protects against brute-force and password spraying attacks. The measure of strength is entropy which is how unpredictable the password is.

To increase entropy, avoid obvious words or single terms. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Password length is really important and 8 is the bare minimum.

Many organisations will set a time frame until this password needs to be changed again.

The best practice is to use a unique password for every account. That way, if one of the accounts is compromised, the other accounts stay safe. The issue here is trying to remember all these passwords. For this we use a password manager.

A password manager stores all your credentials in one encrypted database. To get access to this account, you require extra authentication. Good password managers can also generate random, strong passwords automatically. It will also check if your passwords are weak or compromised.

Many users reuse passwords across sites and thats why the industry is shifting towards password-less authentication. Instead of passwords, we can use biometrics like a fingerprint.

Admins often use just-in-time (JIT) permissions. It works by instead of giving permanent admin rights, a technical requests temporary credentials from a secure password vault. This vault generates short lived logins based on primary credentials. Once the work is done, the credentials expire automatically.

In summary:
- Strong, unique passwords with high entropy
- Password managers to handle complexity
- Moving towards password-less logins
