### Notes

When you sign in to a website, you will be asked for a username or password, then you might be asked for a code that is sent to your mobile. This is a multi-factor authentication. The username and password is the first factor, then the code send to the other device is the second factor.

The most common factors include:

- Something you know: password, a pin, or an unlock pattern on your phone. These are memorised secrets that only you should know.

- Something you have: A smart card, a USB security key, or a hardware token that displays random codes. This includes your smartphone receiving SMS login codes or running a software token app.

- Something you are: Biometrics like a fingerprint or a face scan.

- Somewhere you are: Your physical location determined by GPS on your IP address.

The strength in security is when you combine these different factors.
