### Notes

Patching is an update to a system or software that mends a vulnerability.

A zero day is a vulnerability not known to a vendor. The term zero day comes from the fact that the vendor has known about the vulnerability for zero days.

It is a good idea to get cybersecurity insurance cover to prevent lost revenue, data recovery costs, Money lost to phishing, and privacy lawsuit costs.

Most covers will not cover everything. This can include acts that are intentional or someone transferring funds. 

Ransom ware has become increasingly popular that most organisations are taking out insurance to protect their organisations.

To limit the scope of an exploit, we can split the organisation into segments to prevent the attacker getting access to the entire network.

NGFWâ€™s (Next Generation Firewalls) are an excellent way to block unwanted or unnecessary traffic between VLANâ€™s (Virtual Local area networks) 

To create an air gap between devices, you need to use two different devices, one for each system. This means that one device cannot get access to the other device.  We can use segmentation to split a switch into two separate VLANâ€™s that cannot access each other. This saves money on devices. 

Sometimes there are patches you cannot deploy because they affect the system. Someways to make these systems secure would be:
- Disable the service
- Revoke access to the application
- Limit external access
- Modify internal security controls and software firewalls.

When deciding whether to keep a system when it can no longer be patched will be deciding whether to make an exception or exemption. Not everything can be patched. But this device or application may be to valuable for the organisation or will take a long time to exchange with something more secure. 

Not all vulnerabilities are as dangerous as others which will help make a decision whether to remove or keep the system. For example, if the vulnerability has to be done in person on the device, We can use other security measures to protect against these threats. 

It takes a lot of people to look at the risks and decide what to do.

Once the patch is complete, it is worth performing a vulnerability scan to make sure the threat has been cleared from the system.

It is important to have a reporting feature that allows you track which systems have been patched and what vulnerabilities they have. This is very important when the scale of the organisation increases.
