### Notes

Penetration testing is where we preform an attack on our system to see if we can Gain access or data. This is a great way to see what your system does and where there are weaknesses in your system. 

NIST (National Institution of standards and technology) release a technical guid to information testing and assessment. 

Before any testing is done, the rules of engagement must be agreed apon by both parties (the organisation and the penetration tester). These rules stipulate what the tester can and cannot do during the test (the scope). It also specifies when the attack will take place. 

There are multiple types of penetration testing such as, physical, internal, external, or digital.

Itâ€™s important that you take care when exploiting vulnerabilities to prevent taking down production systems.

The attack will start with the initial exploit then they will use lateral movement to jump to another machine or to an account with better privileges. From there we may want to create a backdoor in the system incase someone tries to patch the vulnerability we found. From there we pivot round and gain access to other parts of the organisation. 

Responsible disclosure programs are designed for testers to come forward about vulnerabilities they find on an organisation so that they can patch their systems. This is rewarding to the tester as there is sometimes a reward. This is known as a Bug Bounty program.
