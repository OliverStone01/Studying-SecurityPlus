# Studying-SecurityPlus
This repo is where all my study notes, flashcards, test questions, and a journal on mock test results are kept. For studying, I'm watching and taking notes from Professor Messer on YouTube, Reading the official Security+ book while taking notes and then creating flashcards and practice questions from my notes.
