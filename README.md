# ðŸŽ“ Studying for CompTIA Security+ certificate.

This repository contains my notes, flashcards, and mock tests for my CompTIA Security+ exam. I study by watching, taking notes, and creating flashcards from Professor Messerâ€™s Security+ Playlist on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv&si=QIEwVHMJXwJAWtfl). I also read and listen to the official CompTIA Security+ Study Guide on Audible.
